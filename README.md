# Integrion

Integrion is a modern, multi-paradigm programming language designed to power a cross-platform operating system. Integrion targets a diverse range of devicesâ€”from legacy Windows phones and modern Android devices to smart TVs, wearables, and automotive infotainment systems. It is built for performance, portability, and security, and includes built-in support for AI-assisted features to enhance usability and resource management.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Typing:**  
  Optional static typing for performance and security-critical modules, with dynamic typing for rapid scripting and prototyping.

- **Readable Syntax:**  
  An indentation-based, Python-like syntax paired with minimal ceremony for clarity and maintainability.

- **Multi-Paradigm Support:**  
  Combines imperative, object-oriented, functional, and concurrent programming constructs to suit a wide array of application domains, from OS kernels to security software.

- **High Performance & Portability:**  
  Implemented in Rust to ensure maximum performance and cross-platform portability via LLVM-based backends.

- **Built-In Concurrency:**  
  Lightweight concurrency primitives inspired by modern approaches (e.g., goroutines) to enable efficient multitasking in resource-constrained environments.

- **Integrated AI Support:**  
  A standard library and language features aimed at simplifying the integration of AI capabilities for smart assistance and user support.

## Project Structure

- **interpreter-core/**  
  The core of the Integrion interpreter, written in Rust, responsible for parsing, AST generation, and code execution.

- **docs/**  
  Documentation and design specifications.

- **examples/**  
  Sample Integrion code illustrating language features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust Toolchain:**  
  Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

- **Git:**  
  Install Git for Windows from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### Setting Up Locally (Windows 11)

1. **Install Git:**  
   Download and install Git for Windows.

2. **Configure Git in Command Prompt or PowerShell:**  
   Open a Command Prompt (or PowerShell) and run:

   ```bat
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

3. Clone the Repository:
   Create a directory for your project, then clone the repository:

   cd C:\path\to\your\projects
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/integrion.git

4. Initialize the Rust Project:
   Navigate to the repository folder and create the interpreter core project:

   cd integrion
   cargo new interpreter-core --bin

5. Make Your First Commit:
   Inside integrion\interpreter-core, add and commit the initial project files:

  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up Integrion interpreter core in Rust"
  git push origin master

  Future Roadmap
Core Syntax & Parser:
Define the Integrion grammar with Python-like readability and dual static/dynamic typing.

Interpreter Implementation:
Build a modular interpreter core in Rust for efficient cross-platform execution.

Concurrency & Security Modules:
Integrate lightweight concurrency primitives and language-level security features.

AI & System Integration Libraries:
Develop built-in libraries for AI functionality and secure, seamless ecosystem integration.
